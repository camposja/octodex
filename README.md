# Octodex

## The purpose of creating this project was to practice utilizing Flexbox, HTML & CSS. The practice included creating a website from scratch which is a replica of GitHub's Octodex mascot.

- The Octodex cat is GitHub's fun mascot. In the original version fan's have submitted their cool versions of the Octodex cat. All these version made for a fun project.

- As a Web Design novice, I created this website to practice implementing a reactive web design that adapts to different window sizes.  

- The technologies utilized in the creation of this app were:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Flexbox
